# Brewery app

This is a brewery app made by ```create-react-app``` to fetch and show breweries from https://api.openbrewerydb.org.
Created by Me (Yahya) and deployed to nelify. The link to public webpage is [here](https://brewery123.nelify.app)

The app is responsive (or at least to some extent). The stylings are made using Vanilla css. I avoided Bootstrap and other frameworks because 
with the app being small, css stylesheet are manageable and give high customisability.
